## CSS Styling Exercise

**Objective**: Practice your CSS skills by styling a semantic HTML page about "Space Exploration."

### Space Exploration - An Overview

Space exploration is the ongoing discovery and exploration of celestial structures in outer space by means of continuously evolving and growing space technology. While the study of space is carried out mainly by astronomers with telescopes, its physical exploration is conducted both by unmanned robotic space probes and human spaceflight. It's a testament to human innovation and curiosity, as we seek to understand our place in the vast universe.

### Instructions:

1. Start with the semantic HTML "Space Exploration" page in [CodePen](https://codepen.io/).
2. Your task is to style the page using CSS. Here are some requirements:
    - **Color Scheme**: Use a pleasant color scheme. If you need inspiration, check out [Color Hunt](https://colorhunt.co/) for some trendy palettes.
    - **Header Styling**: Style the header differently from the main content.
    - **Navigation**: Make the navigation links horizontally aligned and change their appearance on hover.
    - **Typography**: Use a different font for headers (`h1`, `h2`) and paragraphs (`p`).
    - **Spacing**: Add some margin and padding to space things out nicely.
3. Play around and get creative! Try to add additional styling elements you're curious about.
4. Once you're satisfied, save your pen and share the link.
